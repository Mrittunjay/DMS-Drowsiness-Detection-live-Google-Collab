Driver Monitoring System, Drowsiness Detection Live video streaming using Google Collab


Driver monitoring systems (DMS) monitor the driver’s attention, alertness and behavior to ensure they are actively engaged in the driving task. These systems typically deploy camera based computer vision algorithms to detect signs of driver distraction, drowsiness, or impairment. DMS systems can also be integrated with other vehicle safety features such as lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control to improve their effectiveness.


Drowsiness detection:
Drowsiness detection can be implemented using DLIB library deep learning based modules and face landmark detection. And face_utils library for basic convolution operations. 
Using eye landmarks from the shape predictor ‘68 facial landmarks’ and calculating the eye aspect ratio we can detect if the driver is ACTIVE or DROWSY.
